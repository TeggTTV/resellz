This is a NextJS project I made to showcase a possible idea of mine.

This project is an app made to help make more money for resellers by taking their data and using it to tweak prices. It also has a custom ebay/marketplace search feature to find what is selling the most at the moment.

Maybe I'll turn this into its max potential?

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
